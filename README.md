# Spaceship Titanic - Classification Project

This project tackles the **Spaceship Titanic** dataset, a fictional classification challenge hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview). The goal is to predict whether passengers were transported to an alternate dimension based on a variety of personal and travel-related features.

## Project Overview

- **Problem Type**: Binary classification
- **Target Variable**: `Transported`
- **Features**: Includes `HomePlanet`, `CryoSleep`, `Cabin`, `Age`, `VIP`, `RoomService`, and more
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
  - Classification models using `TensorFlow` and `TensorFlow Decision Forests`

## Getting Started
